Magehook serves as an abstraction layer designed to facilitate the seamless creation and efficient
dispatching of (personalized) webhooks from Magento 2. It's important to note that this module
doesn't come equipped with pre-defined webhook events by default.

## More
Creating layers of abstraction and tools to simplify complex situations for other developers is a major source of motivation for me. It's one of the reasons I love what I do. Each of my code repositories aims to achieve this. Take a look at my other repositories - they might be helpful for you.
